                    <p>Sunil Chhetri (born 3 August 1984) is an Indian professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains both Indian Super League club Bengaluru and the India national team.</p>
                    <p>Widely regarded as one of the greatest Indian players of all time, Chhetri is the third-highest international goalscorer among active players, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, the joint fifth-highest of all time, and also both the most-capped player and the all-time top goalscorer for India.</p>
                    <p>Chhetri began his professional career at Mohun Bagan in 2002, moving to JCT where he scored 21 goals in 48 games. Sunil was part of Delhi team in the 59th edition of Santosh trophy held at Delhi. He scored 6 goals in that tournament including a hat-trick against Gujarat. Delhi lost to Kerala in the quarter finals and he scored in that match too. He signed for Major League Soccer side the Kansas City Wizards in 2010, becoming the third player from the subcontinent of note to go abroad. He returned to India's I-League where he played for Chirag United and Mohun Bagan before going back abroad, at Sporting CP of the Primeira Liga, where he played for the club's reserve side.</p>
                    <p> Chhetri helped India win the 2007, 2009, and 2012 Nehru Cup, as well as the 2011, 2015, and 2021 SAFF Championship. He has also helped India win the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup, which qualified them to their first AFC Asian Cup in 27 years, scoring twice in the final tournament in 2011. Chhetri has also been named AIFF Player of the Year a record six times in 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2017 and 2018â€“19.</p>
                    <p>Chhetri received the Arjuna Award in 2011 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Padma Shri award in 2019, India's fourth highest civilian award. In 2021, he received the Khel Ratna Award, India's highest sporting honour and became the first footballer to receive the award.</p>

                    <h3>Style Of Play</h3>
                    <p>Sunil, generally, plays as a Left Winger in his club football to help and supply his foreign Centre Forward. But for national team, he generally plays as a Centre Forward which helped him to act as a finisher and also to score 84 goals from 125 Appearances for his national team with a better goals per game ratio than his club football career. Chhetri's style of play increasingly features elements identical to Kom's trademark never-quit commitment and sheer grit. Where he was once all spark plug and no gears, now it's watchful cruise control, but without concession on any scoring opportunity. In his entertaining From Delhi To The Den (written along with Owen Amos), the former India manager Stephen Constantine says this "hard-working striker with superb technique" is crucial to team spirit because he embodies fearlessness. You can see it in the goals he racks up, one after another: the astonishing 80-yard run foxing seven separate defenders to score against Kyrgyzstan, the imperious chip over Kenya's outclassed goalkeeper, the edges, parries and headers piled up relentlessly to break every Indian record.</p>
                    <p>"Chhetri is in a category all by himself", says Marcus Mergulhao, Goan sports journalist of The Times of India, who is himself one of Indian football's most respected institutions. He told me, "As a player, he has made youngsters fall in love with the game. As a person, he has made the media take note. He is the face and voice of Indian football, who has inspired a generation and given us hope. What's more, he's playing his very best at the moment. The last three years have been phenomenal. The ultimate gift the current crop of footballers can give back to him is take India among the top ten in Asia, and play against the top teams on a regular basis. Chhetri would be pleased with that."</p>
